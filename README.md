In INFOTC-2040, In this course I implemented algorithms and data structures to solve problems while ultilizing paradigms offered by<br >
the programming language such as procedural, object-oriented, protocol-oriented, functional, and declarative. <br>
This course taught me how to determine an algorithm's efficiency, designing application architecture, and develop applications.<br >
I also built and used libraries and application programming interfaces.<br >
This class was challenging, but very fun!
